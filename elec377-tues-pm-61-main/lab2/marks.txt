Documentation 2.5/3.5:
-while documentation is good on a high-level, you do not cover any details regarding which commandline functions you implemented, and how theyre designed
-please give your documentation files a type (such as .txt, .md, etc.)

Testing Docs 2/3.5:
-splitCommandLine evidently does not behave as expected, the last element is c3c7f4f0
-it's okay if your code doesn't work as expected, but saying it does work when it clearly doesnt is not acceptable
-you never test external commands

Code Correctness 1/1.5:
-splitCommandLine does not behave as expected, you are missing a very easy step
    -// add a null to end of array (Step 2)


Code Clarity 1.5/1.5:
-code is clear and legible1
