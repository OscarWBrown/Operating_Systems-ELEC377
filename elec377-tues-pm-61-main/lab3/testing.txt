This lab was tested for three different scenarios: many producers to many consumers, 1 producer to many consumers, and many producers
 to 1 consumer. These are given by test 1, 2 and 3 respectively (not that the first number afer t or out denotes the test number). 
As you can see, in all cases, the data read in from the producer is taken by the consumers and put into the out files. 
You can tell this functions properly because the numbers from the input files remian in the correct order when looking in the output files.
