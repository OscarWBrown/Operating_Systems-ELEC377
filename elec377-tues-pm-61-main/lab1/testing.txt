The lab was tested by checking numerous output cases. First, the output was checked from two separate netID users of the VM.
First, the output for 20hgww is should in lab1.out1, and it can be seen that the UIDs are 1007. when checked from
20owb (lab1.out3), the UIDs show as 1008. As the name would suggest, these are indeed unique identifiers.

The output was then tested using a root terminal. Here the unique identified was 0, which is the correct UID for a root user
by convention. 

Lastly, the output was tested using a data dump command (dd) as opposed to cat. By generating output using dd instead of cat, we can see
the name field of the PCB info was dd instead of cat.

These above cases confirm that the contents of the /proc/lab1 file are being dynamically and correctly generated upon a request for the
file
